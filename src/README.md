# _Word Puzzle_

#### _A word puzzling game that removes the vowels from a string so your friends can guess it._

#### By _**Christopher Siems**_

## Description

This is a website that uses a method to replace vowels in a string with the dash symbol "-" to create a word puzzle to solve. The resulting word puzzle will be on a new page that does not show the original string so that another person can try and guess it.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Clone this repository.
* Install Gradle and Java
* Run:
  `gradle run`
In program directory.
* Open `localhost:4567` in web browser.

## Known Bugs

This app uses a get command that gives away the secret phrase in the URL. I'm desperately trying to figure out how to use a Post command to hide the secret phrase.
